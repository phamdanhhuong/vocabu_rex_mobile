Principles
=========

Why
---
We're here to make language learning easily available to everyone. This once involved tutors, textbooks, and tons of cash. Then Duolingo kicked open the door. Now all you need is a screen, an internet connection, and a few minutes a day to make anything possible. Language belongs to everyone. With Duolingo, so does language learning.

What
----
The taxi driver in Brazil who got a dream job abroad? The Brooklyn girl learning Mandarin so she can speak to her grandma? The businessman who just wants to say ‘croissant' properly in Paris? Duolingo makes all this happen every day. We're everyone's favorite way to learn a language, and learning a language makes anything possible.

How
---
We think learning a language should be nothing to fear and should feel all about fun. We've combined technology with the power of play to make language learning a joy, not a chore. And because Duolingo is free, it really IS open to everyone.

Our mission is to develop the best language learning education in the world and make it universally available.

Everyone can Duolingo.


The Duolingo difference
======================

We're the world's most popular, most enjoyable way to learn a language. No one else comes close.

We make our courses easily available to people who need them most. If you have a screen and an internet connection, you can learn a language. For free.

We make education motivating and inspiring, with bite-sized lessons based on learning science. Duolingo is effective, but it's never a chore.

We're the most inclusive way to learn a language. Duolingo is loved by people of all ages and backgrounds and used across the globe, with 35+ languages to learn and more on the way.

We root for our learners. They set learning goals at the beginning of their Duolingo journey, and we help them stay on top of their progress every day. Coffee break? The perfect time for a lesson.

Our team of linguists, engineers, designers, and community experts is hard at work developing new and better courses. And we're always expanding our universe of language-learning tools. Like language, we never stand still.

Why language learners are choosing Duolingo.


Brand personality
=================

Inspiring
---------
Anything is possible when you Duolingo. From a child growing up in poverty to a taxi driver looking for a career boost to a retired person and their bucket list, everyone can Duolingo. And every new word makes your world bigger.

Inclusive
---------
Everyone is welcome to learn on Duolingo, because language belongs to everyone. We've made our product as accessible as possible for all types of learners, and we create content that is inviting and welcoming to all. Language learning opens doors, and that's why our doors are open to everyone. For free, forever.

Can-do
------
We're all about rooting for our learners and helping them make progress. We bring the energy so our learners can bring their A+ game. Learning a language? It's not a pipe dream. It's in the palm of your hand.

Curious
-------
Knowing even a little bit of another language makes your life better. More interesting, more worldly, and more rich with possibility. Duolingo is a pastime that's about doing more than passing the time. What will you learn today?

Quirky
------
We put the fun in language fundamentals. Learning doesn't have to be intimidating or boring. And with the animated cast of characters you'll meet and the lovably eccentric sentences you'll learn, boring is something Duolingo will never be.

How we want the world to see us.


Brand personality (analogies)
----------------------------
If Duolingo were a...

Celebrity

Trevor Noah speaks eight languages, and as the host of The Daily Show, we count on him to speak the truth. Funny, accessible, and smart, he breaks down the news into language we all understand.

Vehicle

Who needs doors? The Vespa gets you there faster and free of baggage. It fits your life, wherever you find yourself. Vespa means "wasp" in Italian, but around the globe it stands for sense and style.

Song

Don't Stop Me Now is the song that makes everybody feel good. 40 years after Queen first sang "I'm a rocketship on my way to Mars," it still has us dancing and inspired to do more. It's unstoppable.

Duolingo has a few kindred spirits. Think of these cultural touchstones to get into a Duolingo state of mind.

Today it's grown into a global community of people going above and beyond to make a product they love even better with every sentence, every answer, every event, every report, every upvote. As a result, millions of people are now learning languages from Italian to Navajo — opening up new opportunities, new adventures, new connections, and new possibilities.
