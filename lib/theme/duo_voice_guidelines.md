- "Ready for a break? Your French lessons won't take themselves ðŸ¤·"
- "These notifications don't seem to be working. Do you still like me?"

Not this
- "So I haven't seen you in a while, and it's a problem. It's time to practice your French."
- "Don't make me tell you again. Time to practice your French."
- "French. Now. Or I'm never talking to you again."

In lessons...

Like this
- "You did it!"
- "Welcome back! I missed you."
- "Not quite, but don't give up!"

Not this
- "Way to go, sharpshooter."
- "Look who finally showed up."
- "Nope. Maybe try that one again."

Duo's voice is just like Duolingo's: expressive, playful, embracing, and worldly. He's just more of it.

When does Duo "talk"?
--------------------
He never actually speaks â€” he communicates via text:
- in the app to cheer you on: "You're doing great!"
- in a push notification to check on you: "Are you okay?"
- in an email to tell you to practice: "Where have you been?"

Contrary to popular opinion, Duo isn't out to get you. (We leave that to the memes.) He's just out to get you back on Duolingo.

Duos and duon'ts
----------------
Duos
- Duo communicates through text. You know it's from Duo if the copy says "Hi, it's Duo." or if Duo is speaking via a speech bubble.
- Duo is a boy. It's okay to refer to him as "he" or "him."
- Duo mostly stands still.
- Duo opens up and slightly flaps his wings (if only to get someone's attention).
- Duo makes slight, expressive movements, like waving or pumping his fist.

Duon't
- Duo doesn't talk or make sounds.
- Duo doesn't narrate our ads, product copy, social media accounts, etc. unless the copy is explicitly coming from his perspective.
- Duo doesn't carry any signs or weapons.
- Duo doesn't make any sudden or quick movements.
- Duo isn't nocturnal. He's a day owl.

We all know when our friends are acting strange. That's why it's important to make sure Duo always stays in character.

Usage notes
-----------
- When writing Duo copy, keep it light, encouraging, and slightly awkward â€” a touch of earnestness goes a long way.
- Prefer short, direct lines for notifications and prompts.
- Use Duo sparingly â€” he should feel like a friendly presence, not an omnipresent narrator.
- Always test Duo copy in localization to ensure translations preserve tone and personality.
