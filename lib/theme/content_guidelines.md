Content guidelines
==================

Use these guidelines when publishing stories, user testimonials, press copy, or any content that touches on real people and life-changing situations.

Principle: Respect first
-----------------------
When language learning intersects with difficult life experiences (migration, conflict, loss, trauma, or survival), write with care and respect. Tone down exuberance, avoid flippancy, and prioritize the dignity of the person whose story you're telling.

Examples â€” respectful vs. not
--------------------------------

Like this

Reason #17 to learn a language in 2019: So you can better relate to refugees like Alaa, who escaped war and imprisonment and is now learning Turkish to adjust to his new life in Istanbul.

Not this

Did you know? Learning a language can help you escape war and imprisonment â€” just like Alaa, who is learning Turkish and adjusting to his new life in Istanbul!

Why: the first example is measured, respectful, and centers Alaa rather than sensationalizing trauma. The second example sensationalizes and uses an exclamation tone thatâ€™s inappropriate for the subject.


Context-sensitive tone
----------------------
Different situations call for different tones. Below are simple rules to help choose the right tone.

When celebrating success

- Use excited, short lines and punctuation to celebrate.
- Examples:
  - "Very few of our learners reach a 900 day streak â€” but Louis Pizitz Middle School student Christina did just that! She's taking German in school and using Duolingo to supplement her learning. Herzlichen GlÃ¼ckwunsch, Christina! ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸŽ‰"

When addressing hardship or sensitive topics

- Tone down exuberance and punctuation.
- Use plain, human language that treats the story as someone's life, not content to be monetized.
- Examples:
  - "Reason #17 to learn a language in 2019: So you can better relate to refugees like Alaa, who escaped war and imprisonment and is now learning Turkish to adjust to his new life in Istanbul."


Guidelines for supportive messages
---------------------------------
- When learners succeed: Celebrate clearly and briefly (e.g., "Correct!", "Awesome work!"). Use exclamation points judiciously and where appropriate.
- When learners make mistakes: Be helpful and encouraging. Short, actionable prompts work best (e.g., "Not quite correct. Try again!").
- Avoid long, apologetic explanations in-place of simple guidance.

Examples â€” short vs. long (use the short)

Like this (preferred)

- "Correct!"
- "Awesome work!"
- "Not quite correct. Try again!"
- "Oh no! You're out of health. Want to ask a friend for a refill?"

Not this (avoid)

- "You are correct"
- "You have successfully passed this level"
- "Incorrect."
- "We're very sorry, but you don't have any health left. Hopefully, a friend will share some health with you â€” do you want to ask them?"


Practical tips
--------------
- Read the context before choosing tone: is the user being congratulated, corrected, or informed about something sensitive?
- Prefer short sentences and active verbs in UX flows.
- Reserve emojis, exclamation points, and celebratory language for clear wins and joyful moments.
- If in doubt, err on the side of humanity and restraint â€” treat the subject like a person, not a metric.

Localization & cultural sensitivity
----------------------------------
- Work with localizers to adapt tone and examples for each market.
- Avoid references and idioms that might not be universal unless you provide brief context.
- Remember that some celebrations or metaphors may not translate well â€” choose universals when possible.

When to escalate
-----------------
If story content includes trauma, legal status, or medical details, consult a content lead and localization reviewer before publishing.
