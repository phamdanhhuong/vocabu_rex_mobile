Voice qualities
===============

Our voice has four key qualities that are felt in both what we say and how we say it. Working together, these qualities make everything we write sound uniquely Duolingo.

- Expressive
- Playful
- Embracing
- Worldly

Putting the voice to work
------------------------

Short checklist for writers and engineers:

1. Choose one dominant voice trait for a message (Expressive / Playful / Embracing / Worldly).
2. Keep sentences short and active. Prefer 10‚Äì14 words for headline lines.
3. Avoid mixing tones inside the same message (e.g., don‚Äôt be playful and condescending).
4. Use contractions and gender-neutral language by default.
5. Localize and test translations ‚Äî keep cultural references universal or explain them.
